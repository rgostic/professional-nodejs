General Notes=============- the core buffer class is allocated outside of javascript VM heap, it sites here without changing and GC does not touch it
- assigning outside of bounds does not throw an exceptionChapter 4=========- always listen for errors from emitters as they will halt execution if not handledChapter 5=========- The process object is one of the few Node.js global objectsChapter 6=========notes.txtas asdfsdfsafdChapter 7=========- core modules are loaded even if a third party module exists with the same name
- modules are cached when they are loaded, so any initialization only happens once
